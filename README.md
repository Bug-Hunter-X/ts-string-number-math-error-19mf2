This code demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript.  The functions `add` and `subtract` are correctly type-annotated to only accept numbers.  However, the attempt to add/subtract strings results in a type error. This example highlights the importance of ensuring that type safety is maintained throughout all operations. The solution file provides a corrected version where type checking is improved.
